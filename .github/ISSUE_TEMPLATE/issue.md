**Describe the issue**
A clear and concise description of what the issue is.

**To Reproduce**

Please provide failing expressions and the actual parser output. You can use https://jsdoc-type-pratt-parser.github.io/jsdoc-type-pratt-parser/ for this.

Which mode was used:
* [ ] `jsdoc`
* [ ] `closure`
* [ ] `typescript`

(Please be aware that issues with `jsdoc` and `closure` modes probably won't get addressed because of lack of time)

**Expected behavior**
Please provide the expected parser output for the expression if you can.

In which modes would you expect the parser to accept the failing expression:
* [ ] `jsdoc`
* [ ] `closure`
* [ ] `typescript`

**Additional context**
