How to add a new parse type
---------------------------

This project works best with a test-driven design. This is a write-up of the neccessary steps.

For example let's say we want to add typescript predicates i.e. `@returns {x is string}`. To do that it makes sense to
follow these steps:

1. Add a new result type. In this case it is a `RootResult`, that means it can appear as a root node of an AST. 
It is important that we use a type that is not used yet and is prefixed with `JsdocType`. We choose `JsdocTypePredicate`.
A predicate can have to child elements, we call them `left` and `righ`. `left` always has to be a name.
We add the following to the file `src/result/NonRootResult`:
```typescript
export type RootResult =
  // ...
  | PredicateResult

/**
 * A typescript prediciate. Is used in return annotations like this: `@return {x is string}`.
 */
export interface PredicateResult {
  type: 'JsdocTypePredicate'
  left: NameResult
  right: RootResult
}
```

2. Add a test. To test we think about an example expression and how we expect it to be parsed. Then we specifiy these
in a fixture test and use `testFixture` to do this. There the typing can guide us to fill all required fields.
Documentation about this function can be found in `test/fixtures/Fixture.ts`.
There already exist multiple files for different aspects, but for our case we create a new file
`test/fixtures/typescript/predicate.spec.ts`:
```typescript
import { testFixture } from '../Fixture'

describe('typescript predicates', () => {
  describe('should parse a predicate', () => {
    testFixture({
      input: 'x is string',
      modes: ['typescript'],
      expected: {
        type: 'JsdocTypePredicate',
        left: {
          type: 'JsdocTypeName',
          value: 'x'
        },
        right: {
          type: 'JsdocTypeName',
          value: 'string'
        }
      }
    })
  })
})
```

3. Run the tests. With `npm test` we do a typecheck, linting and the unit tests. To do just the unit tests we can use
`npm run test:spec`. If we run `npm test` we first see that there are multiple problems in the transforms.
4. For the `catharsisTransform` and the `jtpTransform` we can simply add `nonAvailableTransform` as these do not support typescript
predicates (see the respective files for examples). The `identityTransform` simply needs to return the same type and the
`stringify` transform should create a valid string output of a given type. These transforms look like this:
```typescript
// catharsis & jtp
{
  // ...
  JsdocTypePredicate: notAvailableTransform
}
// identity
{
  // ...
  JsdocTypePredicate: (result, transform) => ({
    type: 'JsdocTypePredicate',
    left: transform(result.left) as NameResult,
    right: transform(result.right) as RootResult
  })
}
// stringify
{
  // ...
  JsdocTypePredicate: (result, transform) => `${transform(result.left)} is ${transform(result.right)}`
}
```
5. Specify visitor keys. This is the next type error that will occur in file `src/visitorKeys.ts`. These are the
properties of our new type which should be visited by tree traversing functions. In our case these are `['left', 'right']`.
6. Add new tokens. If we run the test again we will get an error for our unit test and can actually start developing our
feature. The message is `Error: The parsing ended early. The next token was: 'Identifier' with value 'is'`. It tells us
that the lexer was not able to parse the token `is`. To fix this we add `'is'` to the `TokenType` in `src/lexer/Token.ts`
and create a new lexing rule in `src/lexer/Lexer.ts`. As this is just a static text token, we can just add
`makeKeyWordRule('is')` to the `rules` array. 
7. Add a parslet. The next error is `Error: The parsing ended early. The next token was: 'is' with value 'is'`, which
tells us that a parslet is missing. We create a new file `src/parslets/predicateParslet.ts` and use `composeParslet` to
create a parslet.
```typescript
import { composeParslet } from './Parslet'

export const predicateParslet = composeParslet({
  name: 'predicateParslet'
})
```
8. Decide if it is a prefix or infix parslet (postfix are also infix parslets). The token we recognize is the `is`. As
this is syntactically an infix operator we can use the `parseInfix` parameter of `composeParslet`. Also we need to add
the `accept` parameter to indicate that we accept tokens of type `is`. For infix parslets we also need to specify the
precedence which could be explained as the 'binding strength' of the infix operator. For now we will just choose
`Precendence.INFIX` and see if something else fails.
```typescript
import { composeParslet } from './Parslet'
import { Precedence } from '../Precedence'

export const predicateParslet = composeParslet({
  name: 'predicateParslet',
  precedence: Precedence.INFIX,
  accept: type => type === 'is',
  parseInfix: (parser, left) => {
    
  }
})
```
9. Implement `parseInfix`. Here `parser` is the currently used parser and `left` is the already parsed part. So we assure
that `left` is indeed a name. If that is the case we can now safely `consume` the `is` token. With this we tell the parser
that we can continue parsing the next token and then proceed to assemble the ast and recursively continue parsing the `right` part of our
expression. To ensure that we indeed get a `RootResult` for our right expression we can use the function `assertRoot`.
This prevents us from getting special results like a `KeyValueResult` which is only valid in certain contexts
(for example in object types or function parameter lists). The resulting file looks like this:
```typescript
import { composeParslet } from './Parslet'
import { Precedence } from '../Precedence'
import { UnexpectedTypeError } from '../errors'
import { assertRootResult } from '../assertTypes'

export const predicateParslet = composeParslet({
  name: 'predicateParslet',
  precedence: Precedence.INFIX,
  accept: type => type === 'is',
  parseInfix: (parser, left) => {
    if (left.type !== 'JsdocTypeName') {
      throw new UnexpectedTypeError(left, 'Predicate always have to have names on the left side.')
    }
    
    parser.consume('is')
    
    return {
      type: 'JsdocTypePredicate',
      left,
      right: assertRootResult(parser.parseIntermediateType(Precedence.INFIX))
    }
  }
})
```
10. Add parslet to grammar. Now we need to tell the parser that we actually want to use this parslet. For this we add
the parslet to the `typescriptyGrammar` array in `src/grammars/typescriptGrammar.ts.
11. Run tests and debug until done. In the end we see that all tests pass and we are done. We can now add some more tests 
if we like.
